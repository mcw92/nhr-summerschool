    "#### Data-parallel neural networks (DPNNs) in `PyTorch`\n",
    "\n",
    "After lunch, you learned about data-parallel training of neural networks. \n",
    "As you already know, this involves distributing the training process across multiple processors to accelerate computation and increase training throughput. \n",
    "`PyTorch` provides the `DistributedDataParallel` (`DDP`) module for this, which abstracts away some of the complexities of implementing data-parallel training in a distributed setting. \n",
    "From the official [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html):  \n",
    ">Distributed data-parallel training is a widely adopted single-program multiple-data training paradigm. The model is replicated on every process, and every model replica will be fed with a different set of input data samples. The `DistributedDataParallel` (`DDP`) module takes care of gradient communication to keep model replicas synchronized and overlaps it with the gradient computations to speed up training. \n",
    "It implements data parallelism at the module level which can run across multiple machines. Applications using `DDP` should spawn multiple processes and create a single `DDP` instance per process. `DDP` uses collective communications in the `torch.distributed` package to synchronize gradients and buffers. More specifically, `DDP` registers an autograd hook for each parameter given by `model.parameters()` and the hook will fire when the corresponding gradient is computed in the backward pass. Then `DDP` uses that signal to trigger gradient synchronization across processes.  \n",
    "*The recommended way to use `DDP` is to spawn one process for each model replica. `DDP` processes can be placed on the same machine or across machines, but GPU devices cannot be shared across processes.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that `DDP` only handles the gradient synchronization for you during the training process. \n",
    "If you want to average other quantities like the loss over all processes, you have to implement this explicitly using collective communication functions from `torch.distributed`. \n",
    "This package supports three built-in backends for communication between processors. \n",
    "This [table](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#backends) shows which functions are available for use with CPU/CUDA tensors. \n",
    "Since *Noctua2* connects GPUs with NVLink within a node and Mellanox Infiniband Interconnect between nodes, we use the officially recommended NCCL backend. \n",
    "The [NVIDIA Collective Communication Library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) (NCCL) implements multi-GPU and multi-node communication functions optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and networks. \n",
    "It provides routines, such as all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, and point-to-point transmit and receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to train a DPNN with `PyTorch`'s `DistributedDataParallel` module\n",
    "Below is a recipe for training a DPNN with `DDP` in `PyTorch`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the distributed environment:** Before using `DDP`, you need to somehow define and initialize the distributed environment. This involves setting up the communication backend (which is NCCL for us), specifying the so-called process group, and assigning a unique rank and the world size to each process in the process group. The rank is like a unique process ID and the world size corresponds to the overall number of processes you want to use. \n",
    "2. **Load the data:** Data parallelism means splitting the input data across the processes in the process group and computing the forward and backward passes independently on each rank. This enables parallel processing and reduces the training time. You load the training and validation datasets and distribute them equally over the processes so that each process holds a different, exclusive subset of each dataset. `PyTorch` provides a dedicated sampler for this, the so-called `DistributedSampler`.\n",
    "3. **Model instantiation and replication:** Afterwards, you need to replicate the model across the processes. Each replica of the model will process a subset of the input data provided by the `DistributedSampler`. To do so, you instantiate the model just as in the serial case and wrap it with `DDP`. This ensures that the gradients computed during the backward pass are synchronized across all replicas.\n",
    "4. **Training loop:** Repeat for a specified number of iterations or until convergence is reached:\n",
    "    - *Forward pass*: During the forward pass, each replica of the model independently processes its portion of the input data. \n",
    "    - *Backward pass and gradient synchronization*: After the forward pass, the gradients are computed independently on each replica during the backward pass. The gradients are then synchronized across all replicas using a process called \"all-reduce\". This step ensures that the model parameters are updated consistently across all processes.\n",
    "    - *Optimization step:* Once the gradients are synchronized, the optimizer performs an optimization step to update the model parameters. This step is performed independently and redundantly on each replica.\n",
    "    - *Validation*: After updating the model parameters, you can compute the current model's accuracy on the training and validation dataset. As each process only holds a portion of each dataset, you need to implement some more communication to obtain the accuracy on each whole dataset. \n",
    "5. **Evaluation:** After training, you can evaluate the final model's performance using a held-out test dataset. The evaluation is typically performed on a single process without the need for data parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will do now\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on our morning hands-on session, you will learn how to train a data-parallel version of *AlexNet* in `PyTorch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallelize the training process for *AlexNet* in a data-parallel fashion using `DDP`. \n",
    "- Run your code on four and 16 GPUs of *Noctua2*, i.e., using four and 16 processes in the data-parallel training process, respectively. As parallel runs are inconvenient using Jupyter Notebooks, you need to create `Python` scripts with all class and function definitions and the main part. \n",
    "- Start your `Python` script in parallel with the `srun` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html)) command in a job bash script. Submit your job script to the [SLURM](https://www.schedmd.com/) workload manager with `sbatch` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a corresponding code framework with dataloaders for the training including validation and testing, along with more detailed explanations and instructions for each step. \n",
    "**Normal comments with '#' describe code as usual, in lines with '##' you need to add code.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define the model\n",
    "As the first step, you again need to define your model architecture. \n",
    "This is just a copy-paste of your `AlexNet` module class from the serial case. \n",
    "Later on, you will wrap an instance of this module with `DDP` to make it distributed data-parallel (the magic happens here). \n",
    "Save the code below as a separate `Python` module file `model.py` so that you can import the `AlexNet` module class from this file into your main script. "

In each iteration, the model predicts the output for a given input, calculates the error in its prediction as quantified by the loss function, collects the derivatives of the loss w.r.t. its parameters, and optimizes these parameters using gradient descent. \n",

    "### Example job script for SLURM\n",
    "Now it's time to actually run your script on *Noctua2*. \n",
    "As a normal user, you do not have root rights on a supercomputer. This means you cannot install any software you want but software is made available to you via pre-installed modules. On top of that, you cannot use compute resources as you wish but compute resources are managed among all users by a so-called job scheduler. \n",
    "\n",
    "Job scheduling on a supercomputer is like managing a busy restaurant. Imagine you have a restaurant with many tables, and many customers want to be served at the same time. To serve everyone efficiently, you need a system to manage who gets seated at which table and when. Similarly, many people or organizations typically want to use a supercomputer to run their programs or simulations at the same time. Job scheduling is the process of deciding which jobs (programs or tasks) should run on the supercomputer, when they should start, and how long they can use the resources. \n",
    "The job scheduler, like a restaurant manager, looks at the incoming jobs and determines the best order and timing for execution. It takes into account factors such as job priority, estimated runtime, resource availability, and fairness. For example, a critical job that requires a lot of computing power may be given a higher priority and scheduled to run as soon as possible, while a smaller job that can be completed quickly might be scheduled to run in between larger jobs. \n",
    "The job scheduler also ensures that the supercomputer's resources, like processors, memory, and storage, are used efficiently. It assigns these resources to different jobs based on their requirements and availability, making sure that multiple jobs can run concurrently without interfering with each other. In this way, a job scheduler on a supercomputer manages the incoming workload, organizes the jobs, and allocates resources effectively to maximize the utilization and performance of the supercomputer, just like a restaurant manager aims to serve all customers in the most efficient way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many of the world's supercomputers and computer clusters, *Noctua2* uses the SLURM workload manager, a free and open-source job scheduler for Linux kernels. \n",
    "It provides three key functions:\n",
    "- Allocating access to compute resources to users for some time so they can perform work,\n",
    "- Providing a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work, and\n",
    "- Arbitrating contention for resources by managing a queue of pending jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "SLURM is the workload manager on about 60\\% of the TOP500 supercomputers.\n",
    "To run a job on a supercomputer, you need to submit a batch job script to SLURM with the `sbatch` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)) command. \n",
    "This job script specifies which compute resources you need for how long, along with the actual code to run. \n",
    "Below you find a job script requesting four GPUs on one node. \n",
    "Adapt the code for your needs and save it as a separate bash script `submit_4_gpu.sh`.  \n",
    "To run your script on *Noctua2*, submit it to the SLURM workload manager: `sbatch submit_4_gpu.sh`"
