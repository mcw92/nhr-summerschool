    "#### Data-parallel neural networks (DPNNs) in `PyTorch`\n",
    "\n",
    "After lunch, you learned about data-parallel training of neural networks. \n",
    "As you already know, this involves distributing the training process across multiple processors to accelerate computation and increase training throughput. \n",
    "`PyTorch` provides the `DistributedDataParallel` (`DDP`) module for this, which abstracts away some of the complexities of implementing data-parallel training in a distributed setting. \n",
    "From the official [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html):  \n",
    ">Distributed data-parallel training is a widely adopted single-program multiple-data training paradigm. The model is replicated on every process, and every model replica will be fed with a different set of input data samples. The `DistributedDataParallel` module takes care of gradient communication to keep model replicas synchronized and overlaps it with the gradient computations to speed up training. \n",
    "It implements data parallelism at the module level which can run across multiple machines. Applications using `DDP` should spawn multiple processes and create a single `DDP` instance per process. `DDP` uses collective communications in the `torch.distributed` package to synchronize gradients and buffers. More specifically, `DDP` registers an autograd hook for each parameter given by `model.parameters()` and the hook will fire when the corresponding gradient is computed in the backward pass. Then `DDP` uses that signal to trigger gradient synchronization across processes.  \n",
    "*The recommended way to use `DDP` is to spawn one process for each model replica. `DDP` processes can be placed on the same machine or across machines, but GPU devices cannot be shared across processes.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `torch.distributed` package supports three built-in backends for communication between processors. \n",
    "This [table](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#backends) shows which functions are available for use with CPU/CUDA tensors. \n",
    "Since *Noctua2* connects GPUs with NVLink within a node and Mellanox Infiniband Interconnect between nodes, we use the officially recommended NCCL backend. \n",
    "The [NVIDIA Collective Communication Library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) (NCCL) implements multi-GPU and multi-node communication functions optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and networks. \n",
    "It provides routines, such as all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, and point-to-point transmit and receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to train a DPNN with `PyTorch`'s `DistributedDataParallel` module\n",
    "Below is a recipe for training a DPNN with `DDP` in `PyTorch`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the distributed environment:** Before using `DDP`, you need to define and initialize the distributed environment. This involves setting up the communication backend (NCCL for us), specifying the so-called process group, and assigning a unique rank and the world size to each process in the process group. The rank is like a unique process ID and the world size corresponds to the overall number of processes you want to use. \n",
    "2. **Load the data:** Data parallelism means splitting the input data across the processes in the process group and computing the forward and backward passes independently on each rank. This enables parallel processing and reduces the training time. You load the training and validation datasets and distribute them equally over the processes so that each process holds a different, exclusive subset of each dataset. `PyTorch` provides a dedicated sampler for this, the so-called `DistributedSampler`.\n",
    "3. **Model instantiation and replication:** Afterwards, you need to replicate the model across the processes. Each replica will process a subset of the input data provided by the `DistributedSampler`. To do so, you instantiate the model just as in the serial case and wrap it with `DDP`. This ensures that the gradients computed during the backward pass are synchronized across all replicas.\n",
    "4. **Training loop:** Repeat for a specified number of iterations or until convergence is reached:\n",
    "    - *Forward pass*: Each replica of the model independently processes its portion of the input data. \n",
    "    - *Backward pass and gradient synchronization*: The gradients are computed independently on each replica. They are then synchronized across all replicas using a function called \"all-reduce\". This step ensures that the model parameters are updated consistently across all processes.\n",
    "    - *Optimization step:* Once the gradients are synchronized, the optimizer performs an optimization step to update the model parameters. This step is performed independently and redundantly on each replica.\n",
    "    - *Validation*: After updating the model parameters, you can compute the current model's accuracy on the training and validation dataset. As each process only holds a portion of each dataset, you need to implement some more communication to obtain the accuracy on each whole dataset. \n",
    "5. **Evaluation:** After training, you can evaluate the final model's performance using a held-out test dataset. The evaluation is typically performed on a single process without the need for data parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will do now\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on our morning hands-on session, you will learn how to train a data-parallel version of *AlexNet* in `PyTorch`. This tutorial will guide you through the steps required for parallelizing the training in a data-parallel fashion using `DDP`. \n",
    "As parallel runs are inconvenient using Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to create `Python` scripts from the code snippets provided in this notebook and run the scripts as a batch job on *Noctua2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "1. Get all the building blocks.\n",
    "- **Model:** Define your model <font color='grey'> (~0 min)</font>.  \n",
    "- **Data:** Define the dataloaders <font color='grey'> (~20 min)</font>.   \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Short break with everyone to discuss your results and possible solutions.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run your code in parallel as a batch job on *Noctua2* <font color='grey'> (~30 min)</font>. \n",
    "- Use four GPUs, i.e., four processes in the data-parallel training process. \n",
    "- Start your `Python` script in parallel with the `srun` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html)) command in a job bash script. \n",
    "- Submit your job script to the [SLURM](https://www.schedmd.com/) workload manager with `sbatch` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final break with everyone to discuss your results and possible solutions.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a corresponding code framework with dataloaders for the training including validation and testing, along with detailed explanations and instructions for each step. \n",
    "**Normal comments with '#' describe code as usual, in lines with '##' you need to add code.** \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Get all the building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model: Define the model\n",
    "As the first step, you again need to define your model architecture. \n",
    "This is just a copy-paste of your `AlexNet` module class from the serial case. \n",
    "Later on, you will wrap an instance of this module with `DDP` to make it distributed data-parallel (the magic happens here). \n",
    "Save the code below as a separate `Python` module file `model.py` so that you can import the `AlexNet` module class from this file into your main script. "

    "Now that we have our `AlexNet` model and the distributed CIFAR-10 data, we want to actually train, validate, and test it by optimizing its parameters in a data-parallel fashion with `DDP`. \n",
    "Remember that training a model is an iterative process. In each iteration, the model predicts the output for a given input, calculates the error in its prediction as quantified by the loss function, collects the derivatives of the loss w.r.t. its parameters, and optimizes these parameters using gradient descent. \n",
    "As `DDP` handles the synchronization of the gradients over all processes for you, the structure of the training loop stays basically the same as before. \n",

    "`DDP` takes care of gradient communication to keep the model replicas synchronized. \n",
    "You might also want to track the average loss over all processes during the training. \n",
    "As `DDP` only takes care of the gradient synchronization, you have to implement this explicitly using collective communication functions from `torch.distributed` ([doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#collective-functions)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the serial case, we will define some useful helper functions for validating our model during training and testing it afterwards on unseen data:\n",
    "- `get_right_ddp`: Get the number of correctly predicted and overall samples for a given model on a given dataset. You will need those numbers for calculating your model's accuracy during the training loop on the distributed training and validation datasets.\n",
    "- `compute_accuracy_ddp`: Compute the accuracy of your model's predictions on a given dataset. You will need this function for testing your final model on a held-out test dataset after the training is done. Conceptually the same as for the serial case with some slight technical differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this functionality is defined in the `train_model_ddp` function below. \n",

For example, a critical job that requires a lot of computing power may be given a higher priority and scheduled to run as soon as possible, while a smaller job that can be completed quickly might be scheduled to run in between larger jobs. \n",

It assigns these resources to different jobs based on their requirements and availability, making sure that multiple jobs can run concurrently without interfering with each other. In this way, a job scheduler on a supercomputer manages the incoming workload, organizes the jobs, and allocates resources effectively to maximize the utilization and performance of the supercomputer, just like a restaurant manager aims to serve all customers in the most efficient way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many of the world's supercomputers and computer clusters, *Noctua2* uses the SLURM workload manager, a free and open-source job scheduler for Linux kernels. \n",
    "It provides three key functions:\n",
    "- Allocating access to compute resources to users for some time so they can perform work,\n",
    "- Providing a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work, and\n",
    "- Arbitrating contention for resources by managing a queue of pending jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "SLURM is the workload manager on about 60\\% of the TOP500 supercomputers.\n",
    "To run a job on a supercomputer, you need to submit a batch job script to SLURM with the `sbatch` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)) command. \n",
    "This job script specifies which compute resources you need for how long, along with the actual code to run. \n",
    "Below you find a job script requesting four GPUs on one node. \n",
    "Use the `srun` ([doc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html)) command to execute your `Python` script in parallel on the requested four GPUs.\n",
    "Adapt the code for your needs and save it as a separate bash script `submit_4_gpu.sh`.  \n",
    "To run your script on *Noctua2*, submit it to the SLURM workload manager: `sbatch submit_4_gpu.sh`"
